# Freescale Cup Malaysia
The Freescale Cup is a yearly student competition by Freescale Semiconductors and features a 1/18 scale car which students will then need to assemble and build code so that the vehicle will be able to steer around the track autonomously. 

# Code
The base of this repository uses the TFC resource libraries from Professor Eli and there is a branch called FRDM-TFC which is the example code and that demonstrates the 4 basic functionalities which the car will have to perform. I am using Freescale's CodeWarrior software to debug the code. 

# Hardware 
- FRDM KL25Z (MKL25Z128VLK4)
- TFC Shield
- Line Scan Camera
- Futaba Servo
